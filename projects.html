					<h3>Musical Data Analysis</h3>
					<p>I used Spotify's weekly Top 200 music streaming data between 2021/02/04 ~ 2022/07/14 to figure out if there is a relationship between musical features and song popularity. Then I showed how musical features fary depending on the region of the world a particular song is being listened to.</p>

					<h3>Xiangqi Chess Game</h3>
					<p>The topic of this project was a special version of chess called Xiangqi. We had the following tasks:<br>
						Server-> Implement the specific rules of the Xiangqi within the game server framework. The implementation was done in an object-oriented manner using Java.<br>
						Quality Assurance-> To ensure a correct game progression, the functionality implemented must be extensively tested using JUnit. Additionally, the code quality should be measured and ensured using certain metrics.<br>
						Bot-> Develop a bot in Haskell, so that a human can play against a computer player. The bot should calculate all possible moves for given, valid game states and select one.</p>
